# GDSC Core Team Selection Tasks

Hello everyone! ðŸ˜„ Excited to share my journey through GDSC Core Team selection tasks. This repo showcases my skills in Web Development and Machine Learning. Let's explore my completed tasks:

# Preference 1: ML/AI DevelopmentðŸ¤–

In the domain of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, I embraced Option 1: Data Visualization and Classification. My focus was the Abalone Dataset from Kaggle, a treasure trove of data.

My approach:

1. **In-Depth EDA:** I dived into the dataset, using visualizations to unveil insights. Patterns emerged, guiding subsequent steps.

2. **Crafting the Model:** I created a bespoke Multiple Linear Regression model using the sklearn library. Tailored to the data's complexity, it predicted abalone age based on physical traits.

3. **Metrics for Performance:** Leveraging `sklearn.metrics`, I gauged the model. Metrics like MAE and RMSE provided clarity on predictive power and generalization.

Notably, my Multiple Linear Regression model isn't off-the-shelf; I crafted it to suit the dataset. This underscores my grasp of ML concepts and hands-on aptitude.

# Web Development ðŸ’»

For this task, I embarked on a journey to create a captivating portfolio website that reflects who I am, my skills, and the projects I've worked on. You can explore my responsive website at https://harshk.is-a.dev/. Here's a breakdown of the tabs I've included:

1. **About Me:** Get to know me better and understand my background and interests.

2. **Skills and Abilities:** A comprehensive list of my skills and abilities that demonstrate my expertise.

3. **Education:** Details about my academic journey, including institutions and degrees.

4. **Projects Made:** An overview of the projects I've undertaken, showcasing my practical experience.

5. **Experiences:** Information about any professional experiences I've gained.

6. **Certifications:** Highlights of Certifications I've earned to enhance my skill set.

I believe in the power of responsive design, and I've ensured that my website adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
