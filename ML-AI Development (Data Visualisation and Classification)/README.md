# Abalone Age Prediction Project
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Abalone Age Prediction project repository. I'm super excited to share my journey of diving into data, exploring insights, and creating a machine learning model to predict the age of abalones. So, grab your favorite snack and let's explore!

## Project Overview
For this project, I worked with the Abalone Dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to predict the age of abalones using their physical measurements. Here's how I tackled the challenge:

**1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:** I started by understanding the dataset and getting it ready for analysis. I handled missing data, transformed categorical features if needed, and ensured the data was in good shape.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** EDA is like uncovering hidden stories within the data. I used visualizations and statistical methods to uncover patterns, relationships, and outliers. This step laid the foundation for understanding the data deeply.

**3. Regression Modeling:** To predict abalone age, I ventured into the world of regression. I chose an appropriate algorithm, built the model, and trained it using the dataset. This step involved balancing the art of algorithms and the science of data.

**4. Model Evaluation:** A model's performance tells a lot about its accuracy. I evaluated the model's predictions using various metrics like Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R-squared. These metrics helped me understand how well the model performed.
